				<h3>Web Development</h3>
				<p>I have always been fascinated with technology specifically programming. I took a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and gained coding experience and knowledge both at school and professionally. I now have been working as a web
					developer since then.</p>

				<h3>Project Management</h3>
				<p>Aside from web development, I have been assigned to various leadership roles at school. I never thought that I would be able to apply my learnings even at work and further expand my interest in it. I got different management and
					leadership positions at work. And now I am taking a Masters Degree in Business Administration to further enhance my skillset aside my programming skills from my profession.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>I really love music ever since I was a child. This hobby took me to places to perform as a singer/guitarist to different types of audience and occassions. I never thought that I could earn too using my interest for music.</p>
